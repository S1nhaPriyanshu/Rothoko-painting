# Rothko Painting (HTML & CSS)

🎨 A simple visual replica of a Rothko-style painting using only HTML and CSS.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project was built as part of my journey through the [FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) course. By the time of making this, I had completed the course up to the **CSS Box Model** section.

I practiced:

- Structuring an HTML document
- Styling elements with `width`, `height`, and `background-color`
- Applying `margin`, `padding`, and `border`
- Using the CSS **box model** to control layout

## 📁 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Box Model concepts only)

## 📌 Note

This project was done without any frameworks or advanced CSS — just raw HTML and early CSS concepts to understand layout and design fundamentals.
